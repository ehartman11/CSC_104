        <p>Hello Aspiring Pythonist! <br>
            I'm glad you could make it to the Hub, and I hope you found it to your liking.<br><br>
            My name is Ethan Hartman. I found myself beginning to walk the programming <br>
            path about two years ago as I was starting my second deployment in the navy, <br>
            and I quickly jumped down the rabbit hole into the wonderful world of Python.<br>
            As a beginner I found that it was the most intuitive syntactic design that gave <br>
            me the greatest boost in learning the fundamentals of programming.<br><br>
            It so inspired me that I began to truly pursue computer science as career field <br>
            last year. I couldn't think of a better way to give back than to do my part in <br>
            attempting to connect as many other new programmers, and those more advanced, <br>
            to the many resources I have used that have helped me along my own journey.<br><br>
            Please continue to utilize this site as a jumpstart into learning and achieving <br>
            your own goals and dreams. All are welcome to email me with any questions or <br>
            suggestions, or just to say hi!<br>
            Always remember:<br>
            "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.<br>
            Good programmers write code that humans can understand"<br>
